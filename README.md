# Product Manager

A fully functional Flutter application that demonstrates fetching data from an external API, state management, filtering, and building a complete user flow from product discovery to cart management.

## 🚀 Features

* **Product Listing:** Fetches and displays a list of products from a remote API (`dummyjson.com/products`).
* **Search & Filter:** Includes a custom text field to seamlessly search and filter products in real-time.
* **Product Details:** Detailed view for each product, showcasing the product image, title, description, and an option to add the product to the cart.
* **Cart Management:** 
  * Add products to a cart with a single tap.
  * Real-time cart badge counter on the Home Screen.
  * Prevents adding duplicate items to the cart, notifying the user via Snackbars.
  * View added items in a dedicated Cart Screen.
* **State Management:** Efficient and reactive state management using the `provider` package to handle both products and cart data globally.
* **Loading & Error States:** Provides a smooth user experience with loading indicators during data fetching and error messages if the API call fails.
